# User Story
As an avid consumer of movies and television, I would like an app that allows me to share what I am watching with a group of friends.  I would like for my friends to be able to see what I am watching and on what platform so that I can further discuss and interact with them about the movie or show.

## Future 
We would like to add the ability to improve the users profile allowing them to add a user image. We would like to add the ability to delete a show if they are no longer watching it. We would like to add a newsfeed page that allows you to see what shows your friends are watching.  We would also like to implament a section that allows users to comment and discuss the shows that they are watching.  Ultimately we would like to be able to have a notification sent to a users friends when they start watching a show or movie.
